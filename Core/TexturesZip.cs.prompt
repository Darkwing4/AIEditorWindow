Find all textures in the project and display them in lists grouped by texture compression type.
- Each list should be collapsible.
- Optimize for large lists (e.g., implement virtualization/scrolling) so the editor doesn’t lag while browsing all textures.
- Exclude textures located in any “*/Editor/*” folders.
- Under each texture, show its import settings and their values.
- Texture settings should be editable.
- Add a label above the lists explaining how textures are grouped.

In addition to grouping by compression, create an equivalent list grouped by texture type (e.g., sprite, lightmap, etc.).
- Add a label before each list explaining the grouping principle.

To add:
- Similarly group textures by their size.
