# AIEditorWindow

**LLM‑powered Unity Editor extension** – create, refactor and version EditorWindows with GPT‑4o, Claude 3 and any other
LLM provider you plug in.

> ⚠️ **Careful what you prompt for!**  
> Type _"encrypt all .cs files with Caesar cipher"_ — and you'll get an EditorWindow that does just that.  
> This tool gives LLM full control over editor script generation.          
> Whatever you ask — will be generated.

## Motivation

This project grew out of a desire to integrate LLMs into real-world development.  
Unfortunately, the code generated by LLMs is not always predictable or production-ready — it's often unreadable and hard
to trust.

Yet there’s one area where LLMs consistently shine: creating EditorWindows.  
These scripts are boilerplate-heavy, rarely elegant, and perfect for automation.

This repository is a proof of concept: **can we safely hand off tedious editor-only scripting to an LLM and focus on the real work instead?**  
Spoiler: _yes, we can_.

## What It Does

- Generate custom EditorWindows by describing what you want.
- Supports multiple LLMs (OpenAI, Claude, etc) — easy to extend.
- Store your prompt in a `.cs.prompt` file right next to the script.
- Prompts are editable, versioned, and tracked in Git.
- Prompt editor in Unity supports Undo/Redo and auto-saving.
- Add extra .cs files as context to guide the LLM.
- Fully editor-only — nothing leaks into builds.

## Installation

### Unity Package Manager (Git URL)

1. Open **Window ▸ Package Manager**.
2. Press **+ ▸ Add package from Git URL…**
3. Paste:
   ```
   https://github.com/Darkwing4/AIEditorWindow.git
   ```
4. Open **Edit ▸ Project Settings ▸ AI Tools**, enter the API key(s) for the provider(s): OpenAI, Anthropic, …

### Requirements

- Unity - tested only with `6000.0.49f1`

## Quick Start

1. Create the script via IDE or GPTGenerated/AIAIEditorWindowCreator
   ```csharp
   using AIEditorWindowTool.Windows;
   using UnityEditor;
   
   public class BookmarkableHistory : AIEditorWindow
   {
    [MenuItem("GPTGenerated/BookmarkableHistory")]
    public static void ShowWindow() {
        GetWindow<BookmarkableHistory>("Bookmarkable History");
    }
   }
   ```
   
2. Open the window & enter the prompt
   From Unity’s menu choose GPTGenerated ▸ BookmarkableHistory.
   In the built-in GPT panel: paste the prompt, pick your provider/model, and (optionally) drag extra context scripts.

3. Click `Write code` → the LLM returns a full IMGUI implementation, Unity recompile automatically, and the window refreshes with real functionality.

4. Iterate
   - Tweak the prompt or add more context, then press `Rework code` to refine, or `Write code` for write from zero.
   - Use the **Git Files** toolbar to commit or revert generated files in one click.
